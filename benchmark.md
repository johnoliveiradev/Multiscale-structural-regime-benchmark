## Benchmark Definition

A method is considered successful on this benchmark if it can:

1. Distinguish the real system from both null models
2. Do so consistently across multiple spatial resolutions
3. Maintain separation within 95% confidence bounds
4. Identify the regime boundary where separation emerges

Any method may be used.

No assumptions are made about distance, probability, causality, or learning.
